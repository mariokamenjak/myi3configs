# myi3configs
My i3configs and scripts. Use it on your own risk.

Backlight.sh handles keyboard backlight. On every logon after 17:00 it will automatically turn it on.

Update.sh just runs apt-get update and apt-get upgrade

wallpaper.sh tells feh to randomly pick background images from a folder and change them every 10 minutes. You need to install feh for it to work. You have to make the folder yourself and populate it with images.

The rest are my modified i3configs. You might need to install some programs first to use all of the modifications.
